This mod adds one thing, and that is a whole lot of legendary guns from one of my personal favorite games, Borderlands 3. I was inspired to make this after playing Yuyutsu's mod Guns, Glorious Guns! which is one of the best mods out there for early game rangers and can procedurally generate billions of guns. Not having the knowledge to do that, I opted to instead spread out the guns throughout the game as rare drops from bosses, minibosses, and specific enemies in the spirit of Borderlands.
